# Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) - Proof of Concept (PoC)

This repository presents a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** for using **Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)**, a powerful machine learning algorithm, to solve real-world classification problems.  

The PoC includes two practical examples:
1. **Fraud Detection in Banking:** Identifying suspicious financial transactions based on patterns in transaction data.
2. **Medical Diagnosis:** Predicting whether a patient has a disease based on medical test results.

## üîç **What is Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)?**
**Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)** is an **ensemble learning** algorithm that builds a strong classifier by combining multiple weak models (decision trees).  

It works by:
1. Training a simple decision tree model.
2. Identifying the errors made by the previous model.
3. Training a new model to correct these errors.
4. Repeating the process multiple times to improve accuracy.

GBM is widely used in **fraud detection, medical diagnosis, risk assessment, and financial forecasting** due to its ability to detect complex patterns and improve over time.

## üìå **Project Objective**
This PoC demonstrates how **GBM** can be applied to **fraud detection and medical diagnosis**, showcasing its ability to:
- Improve predictions by iteratively correcting errors.
- Handle complex classification problems with high accuracy.
- Adapt to different types of datasets.

---
## **Example 1: Fraud Detection in Banking**
Banks use **GBM** to analyze financial transactions and identify potential fraud based on various indicators such as:
- **Transaction value**
- **Transaction frequency**
- **International transactions**
- **Use of virtual cards**

### **How It Works**
- The model learns from past transactions, distinguishing between **legitimate** and **fraudulent** activities.
- It refines its predictions as new data becomes available.
- This technique helps **reduce financial losses** by detecting fraud early.

---
## **Example 2: Medical Diagnosis**
Hospitals can use **GBM** to analyze patient medical test results and predict whether they have a specific disease.  
The model considers:
- **Blood pressure**
- **Glucose levels**
- **Cholesterol levels**
- **Obesity and family history**

### **How It Works**
- The model is trained on past patient records where disease presence is known.
- It identifies **patterns and risk factors** associated with the disease.
- When new patient data is provided, it predicts whether the patient is likely to be **healthy** or **ill**.

This approach improves **early diagnosis**, allowing doctors to take preventive actions.

## üìÇ **Project Structure**
The code is available in Google Colab notebooks:

- [Fraud Detection - Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mikeninerbravog/POC_GBM_FraudDetection/blob/master/POC_GBM_FraudDetection.ipynb)
- [Medical Diagnosis - Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mikeninerbravog/POC_GBM_MedicalDiagnosis/blob/master/POC_GBM_MedicalDiagnosis.ipynb)

Each notebook includes:
- **Data preprocessing** to prepare datasets.
- **Training a GBM model** for classification.
- **Model evaluation with performance metrics**.
- **Predictions on new data samples**.
